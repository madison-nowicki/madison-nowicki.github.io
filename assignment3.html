    <p> The <strong>snowy owl</strong> (Bubo scandiacus), also known as the <strong>polar owl</strong>, the <strong>white owl</strong> and the <strong>Arctic owl</strong>,[3] is a large, white <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl> owl</a> of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_owl>true owl</a> family.[4] Snowy owls are native to the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic>Arctic</a> regions of both North America and the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palearctic_realm>Palearctic</a>, breeding mostly on the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra>tundra</a>.[2] It has a number of unique adaptations to its habitat and lifestyle, which are quite distinct from other extant owls.[5] One of the largest species of owl, it is the only owl with largely white plumage.[4] Males tend to be a purer white overall while females tend to more have more extensive flecks of dark brown.[6] Juvenile male snowy owls have dark markings that may appear similar to females until maturity, at which point they typically turn whiter. The composition of brown markings about the wing, although not foolproof, is the most reliable technique to age and sex individual snowy owls.[7]</p>
    <p>Most owls sleep during the day and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnality>hunt at night</a>, but the snowy owl is often active during the day, especially in the summertime.[5] The snowy owl is both a specialized and generalist hunter. Its breeding efforts and entirely global population are closely tied to the availability of tundra-dwelling <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemming>lemmings</a> but in the non-breeding season and occasionally during breeding the snowy owl can adapt to almost any available prey, most often other small <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal>mammals</a> and northerly <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_bird>water birds</a> (as well as, opportunistically, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrion>carrion</a>).[3][6] Snowy owls typically nest on a small rise on the ground of the tundra.[8] The snowy owl lays a very large clutch of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg>eggs</a>, often from about 5 to 11, with the laying and hatching of eggs considerably staggered.[6] Despite the short <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_the_Arctic>Arctic summer</a>, the development of the young takes a relatively long time and independence is sought in autumn.[5]</p>
    <p>The snowy owl is a nomadic bird, rarely breeding at the same locations or with the same mates on an annual basis and often not breeding at all if prey is unavailable.[6] A largely <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration>migratory bird</a>, snowy owls can wander almost anywhere close to the Arctic, sometimes unpredictably <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_migration>irrupting</a> to the south in large numbers.[6][9] Given the difficulty of surveying such an unpredictable bird, there was little in depth knowledge historically about the snowy owl's status. However, recent data suggests the species is declining precipitously.[2][10] Whereas the global population was once estimated at over 200,000 individuals, recent data suggests that there are probably fewer than 100,000 individuals globally and that the number of successful breeding pairs is 28,000 or even considerably less.[2][11] While the causes are not well-understood, numerous, complex environment factors often correlated with <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change>global warming</a> are probably at the forefront of the fragility of the snowy owl's existence.[2][6]</p>

    <p>The snowy owl was one of the many bird species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae, where it was given the binomial name Strix scandiaca.[12] The genus name Bubo is Latin for an horned owl and scandiacus is New Latin for of Scandinavia.[13] The former genera name Nyctea is derivation of Greek meaning "night".[3] Linnaeus originally described the different plumages of this owl as separate species, with the male specimens of snowy owls being considered Strix scandiaca and the likely females considered as Strix nyctea.[3][14] Until recently, the snowy owl was regarded as the sole member of a distinct genus, as Nyctea scandiaca, but mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data shows that it is very closely related to the horned owls in the genus Bubo and the species is now thusly often considered inclusive with that genus.[15][16] However, some authorities debate this classification, still preferring Nyctea. Often authorities are motivated to retain the separate genus on the grounds of osteological distinctions.[3][17]</p>
    <p>Genetic testing revealed a reasonably distinct genetic makeup for snowy owls, being about 8% genetically distinct from other Bubo owls, perhaps giving credence to those who count the species as separate under Nyctea.[3][18] However, a fairly recent shared origin in evolutionary history has been illustrated through a combination of genetic study and fossil review and there is little, other than osteology of the tarsometatarsus, to outright distinguish the snowy owl from other modern species like the Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo).[3][5] Genetic testing has indicated that the snowy owl may have diverged from related species at around 4 million years ago.[3] Furthermore, it has determined that the living species genetically most closely related to the snowy owl is the great horned owl (Bubo virginianus).[3][19] On a broader scale, owls in general have, through genetic materials, been determined to be a highly distinct group, with outwardly similar groups such as Caprimulgiformes revealed to not be at all closely related.[20][21] Within the owl order, typical owls are highly divergent from barn-owls.[4][19] Furthermore, the Bubo genus likely clustered at some point during the evolutionary process with other largish owls, such as Strix, Pulsatrix and Ciccaba, based on broad similarities in their voice, reproductive behaviors (i.e. hooting postures) and a similar number and structure of chromosomes and autosomes.[4][22] A number, but not all, of extant typical owls seem to have evolved from an ancient shared common ancestor with the Bubo owls.[23] In addition to the question of relationship of the traditional Bubo owls to the snowy owls, ongoing ambiguity of the relationship of other similarly large-sized owls has been persistent. These have sometimes either been included in the genus or within separate genera, i.e. the Ketupu or fish owls and the Scotopelia or fishing owls. Despite the adaptive distinctions, the grouping of these large owls (i.e. Bubo, snowy, fish and perhaps fishing owls) appears to be borne out via research of karyotypes.[4][23][19][24][25]</p>
    <p>The fossil history of snowy owls is fairly well documented despite some early confusion on how to distinguish the skeletal structure of the snowy owls from eagle-owls.[26][27] It was determined that the snowy owl once was distributed much more widely and far farther to the south during the Quaternary glaciation when much of the Northern Hemisphere was in the midst of an ice age.[3] Fossil records shows that snowy owls once could be found in Austria, Azerbaijan, Czechoslovakia, England, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Sardinia and Spain as well as in the Americas in Cape Prince of Wales, Little Kiska Island, St. Lawrence Island, and in Illinois.[6][26] In the Late Pleistocene the range expanded southward even more so to Bulgaria (80,000–16,000 years, Kozarnika Cave, W Bulgaria).[28] and much of the Italian Peninsula.[29] Pleistocene era fossil from France, i.e. B. s. gallica, showed that the snowy owls of the time were somewhat bulkier (though still notably smaller than contemporary eagle-owls of the times, which were larger than the eagle-owls of today) and osteologically more sexually dimorphic in size than the modern form (9.9% dimorphism in favor of females in the fossils against 4.8% in the same features today).[30] There are no subspecific or other geographical variations reported in the modern snowy owls, with individuals of vastly different origins breeding together readily due to their nomadic habits.[6] Despite apparent variations in body size, environment conditions are the likely variant rather than genetics.[3] No evidence could be found of phylogeographic variation could be found in snowy owls upon testing. Furthermore, the snowy owl appears to have a similar level of genetic diversity as other European owls.[11][31]</p>

    <p>The snowy owl is mostly white. They are purer white than predatory mammals like polar bears (Ursus maritimus) and Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus).[8] Often when seen in the field, these owls can resemble a pale rock or a lump of snow on the ground.[8] It usually appears to lack ear tufts but very short (and probably vestigial) tufts can be erected in some situations, perhaps most frequently by the female when she is sitting on the nest.[4] The ear tufts measure about 20 to 25 mm (0.79 to 0.98 in) and consist of about 10 small feathers.[5] The snowy owl has bright yellow eyes.[6] The head is relatively small and, even for the relatively simply adapted hearing mechanism of a Bubo owl, the facial disc is shallow and the ear is uncomplicated.[4][5] 1 male had ear slits of merely 21 mm × 14 mm (0.83 in × 0.55 in) on left and 21 mm × 14.5 mm (0.83 in × 0.57 in) on the right.[5] Females are almost invariably more duskily patterned than like-age males.[4][6] In mature males, the upper parts are plain white with usually a few dark spots on the miniature ear-tufts, about the head and the tips of some primaries and secondaries whilst the underside is often pure white.[4] Despite their reputation for being purely white, only 3 out of 129 Russian museum specimens of adult males showed an almost complete absence of darker spots. The adult female is usually considerably more spotted and often slightly barred with dark brown on the crown and the underparts. Her flight and tail feathers are faintly barred brown while the underparts are white in base color with brown spotting and barring on the flanks and upper breast.[4] In confusingly plumaged snowy owls, the sex can be determined by the shape of wing markings, which manifest as bars more so in females and spots in males.[3][33] However, the very darkest males and the lightest females are nearly indistinguishable by plumage.[3] On rare occasion, a female can appear almost pure white, as has been recorded in both the field and in captivity.[34] There is some evidence that some of the species grow paler with age after maturity.[6][35] One study's conclusions were that males were usually but not always lighter and that correctly aging is extremely difficult, sometimes individuals either get lighter, darker or do not change their appearance with age.[34] On the other hand, with close study, it is possible to visually identify even individual snowy owls using the pattern of markings on the wing, which can be somewhat unique in each individual.[36] After a fresh moult, some adult females that previously appeared relatively pale newly evidenced dark, heavy markings. On the contrary, some banded individuals over at least four years were observed to have been almost entirely unchanged in the extent of their markings.[3][6] In another very pale owl, the barn owl (Tyto alba), the sexual dimorphism of spotting appears to be driven by genetics while, in snowy owls, environment may be the dictating factor instead.[3][37]</p>
    <p>The chicks are initially grayish white but quickly transition to dark gray-brown in the mesoptile plumage. This type of plumage camouflages effectively against the variously colored lichens that dot the tundra ground.[4][6] This is gradually replaced by plumage showing dark barring on white. At the point of fledging, the plumage often becomes irregularly mottled or blotched with dark and is mostly solidly dark gray-brown above with white eyebrows and other areas of the face white.[4] Recently fledged young can already be sexed to a semi-reliable degree by the dark marking patterns about their wings.[38] The juvenile plumage resembles that of adult females but averages slightly darker on average.[6] By their second moult fewer or more broken bars are usually evidenced on the wing. The extent of white and composition of wing patterns become more dimorphic by sex with each juvenile moult, culminating in the 4th or 5th pre-basic moult, wherein the owls are hard to distinguish from mature adults.[3][6][7][38][39] Moults usually occur from July and September, non-breeding birds moulting later and more extensively, and are never extensive enough to render the owls flightless.[3] Evidence indicates that snowy owls may attain adult plumage at 3 to 4 years of age, but fragmentary information suggests that some males are not fully mature and/or as fully white in plumage that they can attain until the 9th or 10th year.[6][38][40] Generally speaking, moults of snowy owls occur more quickly than do those of Eurasian eagle-owls.[7]</p>
    <p>The toes of the snowy owl are extremely thickly feathered white, while the claws are black.[4] The toe feathers are the longest known of any owl, averaging at 33.3 mm (1.31 in), against the great horned owl which has the 2nd longest toe feathers at a mean of 13 mm (0.51 in)[5][41] Occasionally, snowy owls may show a faint blackish edge to the eyes and have a dark gray cere, though this is often not visible from the feather coverage, and a black bill.[4] Unlike many other whitish birds, the snowy owl does not possess black wingtips, which is theorized to minimize wear-and-tear on the wing feathers in the other whitish bird types.[42] The conspicuously notched primaries of the snowy owl appear to give an advantage over similar owls in long-distance flight and more extensive flapping flight.[43] The snowy owl does have some of the noise-canceling serrations and comb-like wing feathers that render the flight of most owls functionally silent, but they have fewer than most related Bubo owls. Therefore, in combination with its less soft feathers, the flight of a snowy owl can be somewhat audible at close range.[3][44] The flight of snowy owls tends to be steady and direct and is reminiscent to some of the flight of a large, slow-flying falcon.[3] Though capable of occasional gliding flight, there is no evidence that snowy owls will soar. It is said that the species seldom exceeds a flying height of around 150 m (490 ft) even during passage.[3] While the feet are sometimes described as "enormous", the tarsus is in osteological terms relatively short at 68% the length of those of a Eurasian eagle-owl but the claws are nearly as large, at 89% of the size of those of the eagle-owl.[5][8][17] Despite its relatively short length, the tarsus is of similar circumference as in other Bubo owls.[45] Also compared to an eagle-owl, the snowy owl has a relatively short decurved rostrum, a proportionately greater length to the interorbital roof and a much longer sclerotic ring surrounding the eyes while the anterior opening are the greatest known in any owl.[5][17][46] Owls have extremely large eyes which are nearly the same size in large species such as the snowy owl as those of humans.[47] The snowy owl's eye, at about 23.4 mm (0.92 in) in diameter, is slightly smaller than those of great horned and Eurasian eagle-owls but is slightly larger than those of some other large owls.[5][48] Snowy owls must be able to see from great distances and in highly variable conditions but probably possess less acute night vision than many other owls.[3] Based on the study of dioptres in different owl species, the snowy owl was determined to have eyesight better suited to long-range perception than to close discrimination, while some related species such as great horned owls could probably more successful perceive closer objects.[49] Despite their visual limits, snowy owls may have up to 1.5 times more visual acuity than humans.[3] Like other owls, snowy owls can probably perceive all colors but cannot perceive ultraviolet visual pigments.[50][51][52][53] Owls have the largest brains of any bird (increasing in sync with the size of the owl species), with the size of the brain and eye related less to intelligence than perhaps to increased nocturnality and predatory behavior.[54]</p>

    <p>Snowy owls may be active to some extent at both day, from dawn to dusk, and night.[4] Snowy owls have been seen to be active even during the very brief winter daytime in the northern winter.[5] During the Arctic summer, snowy owls may tend to peak in activity during the twilight that is the darkest time available given the lack of full nightfall.[5][108][109] Reportedly, the peak time of activity during summer is between 9:00 pm and 3:00 am in Norway.[110] The peak time of activity for those owls that once nested on Fetlar was reported between 10:00 and 11:00 pm.[111] According to one authority, the least active times are at noon and midnight.[77] As days become longer near autumn in Utqiaġvik, the snowy owls in the tundra become more active around nightfall and can often be seen resting during the day, especially if it is raining.[109] During winter in Alberta, snowy owls were tracked in the daytime, despite being also active at night (as they were deemed too difficult to track). In the study, they were most active during 8:00–10:00 am and 4:00–6:00 pm and often rested mostly from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm. The owls were perched for 98% of observed daylight and seemed to time their activity to peak times for rodents.[112] The variation of activity is probably in correspondence with their primary prey, the lemmings, and like them, the snowy owl may be considered cathermal.[4][5][113] This species can withstand extremely cold temperatures, having been recorded in temperatures as low as minus 62.5 degrees Celsius with no obvious discomfort and also withstood a 5-hour exposure to minus 93 degrees Celsius but may have struggled with oxygen consumption by the end of this period. The snowy owl has perhaps the second lowest thermal conduction to the plumage on average of any bird after only the Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) and rivals the best insulated mammals, such as Dall sheep (Ovis dalli) and Arctic fox, as the best insulated polar creature.[5][114] Presumably as many as 7 rodents would need to be eaten daily to survive an extremely cold winter's day.[5] Adults and young both have been seen to shelter behind rocks to shield themselves from particularly harsh winds or storms.[6] Snowy owls often spending a majority of time on the ground, perched mostly on a slight rise of elevation.[4] It has been interpreted from the morphology of their skeletal structure (i.e. their short, broad legs) that snowy owls are not well-suited to perching extensively in trees or rocks and prefer a flat surface to sit upon.[3] However, they may perch more so in winter though do so only mainly when hunting, at times on hummocks, Fenceposts, telegraph poles by roads, radio and transmission towers, Haystacks, chimneys and the roofs of houses and large buildings.[5] Rocks may be used as perches at times in all seasons.[5] Though often relatively sluggish owls, like most related species, they are capable of sudden dashing movements in various contexts.[3] Snowy owls can walk and run quite quickly, using outstretched wings for balance if necessary.[4] This owl flies with fairly rowing wingbeats, occasionally interrupted by gliding on stretched wings. The flight is fairly buoyant for a Bubo owl.[4][6] When displaying, the male may engage in an undulating flight with interspersed wingbeats and gliding in a slight dihedral, finally dropping rather vertically to the ground.[4] They are capable for swimming but do not usually do so. Some seen to be swimming were previously injured but young have been seen to swim into water to escape predators if they cannot fly yet. They will also drink when unfrozen water is available.[6][111] Snowy owl mothers have been observed to preen their young in the wild, while pairs in captivity have been observed to allopreen.[77] In the period leading up to breeding, snowy owls switched regularly between searching (for nesting grounds) and loafing, often searching less when snow cover was less extensive.[115]</p>
    <p>Snowy owls will fight with conspecifics in all seasons occasionally but this is relatively infrequent during breeding and rarer still during winter. Dogfights and talon interlocking may ensue if the fight between two snowy owls continues to escalate.[74][77][76] A study determined that snowy owls are able to orient the whitest parts of their plumage towards the sun, spending about 44% of time oriented as such during sunny days and much less on cloudy days. Some authors interpret this as a presumed signal to conspecifics, but thermoregulation could also be a factor.[116][117] It is known that during winter in Alberta that female snowy owls are territorial towards one another and may not leave an area for up to 80 days but males are nomadic, usually only staying 1–2 days in an area (seldom to 3–17 days). The females spent on average seven times as long in a given area than did males.[118] During threat displays, individuals will lower the front of the body, stretch the head low and forward, with partially extended wings and feathers on the head and raise their back.[77] If continuously threatened or cornered, the posture in the threat display may become still more contoured and, if pressed, the owl will like back and attempt to slash with its large talons. The threat displays of males are generally more emphatic than those of females.[6][119] Although snowy owls have been considered as semi-colonial, they do not appear to fit this mold well. Nesting sites can be loosely clustered but this is a coincidental response to concentrated prey and each pair tends to be somewhat intolerant of each other.[6][120] During winter, snowy owls are usually solitary but some aggregations have been recorded, especially nearer the Arctic when more narrow food selection can lead to up to 20–30 owls gathering in an area of about 20 to 30 ha (49 to 74 acres).[6][121] Congregations were also recorded in the winter in Montana, where 31–35 owls wintered in a 2.6 km2 (1.0 sq mi) area, owls mostly grouped in loose aggregations of 5–10 owls each or occasionally side-by-side or about 20 m (66 ft) apart.[122] In extreme cases in Utqiaġvik, the owls may have exceptionally close active nests that may be down to only 800 to 1,600 m (2,600 to 5,200 ft) apart.[70] Juvenile males appear to be especially prone to loose associations with one another, appearing to be non-territorial and able to hunt freely in front of one another.[6] In a 213 km2 (82 sq mi) area in and around Utqiaġvik, productive years may have about 54 nests while none may be found in poor years.[6] Utqiaġvik may have about 5 owls in early summer every 1.6 km (0.99 mi), have a nest spacing of 1.6 to 3.2 km (0.99 to 1.99 mi) and the owls territory size is about 5.2 to 10.2 km2 (2.0 to 3.9 sq mi).[6] In Churchill, Manitoba, nest spacing averaged about 3.2 km (2.0 mi).[123] In Southampton Island in a year when the owls nested there, nest spacing averaged 3.5 km (2.2 mi), with the closest two 1 km (0.62 mi) apart and density per nest was 22 km2 (8.5 sq mi).[124] In Nunavut, densities could go from 1 owl per 2.6 km2 (1.0 sq mi) in a productive year to 1 owl per 26 km2 (10 sq mi) in a poor year and from 36 nests in a 100 km2 (39 sq mi) area to none at all.[125][126] Owl density on Wrangel Island in Russia was observed be a single bird each 0.11 to 0.72 km2 (0.042 to 0.278 sq mi).[127] The first known study of winter territories took place in Horicon Marsh where owls ranged from 0.5 to 2.6 km2 (0.19 to 1.00 sq mi) each.[64] In Calgary, Alberta, mean territory size of juvenile females in winter was 407.5 ha (1,007 acres) and adult females was 195.2 ha (482 acres).[118] Wintering owls in central Saskatchewan were radio-monitored, determining that 11 males had an average range of 54.4 km2 (21.0 sq mi), while that of 12 females was 31.9 km2 (12.3 sq mi) with the combined average being 53.8 km2 (20.8 sq mi).[128]</p>

    <p>The snowy owl can live a long life for a bird.[6] Records show that the oldest snowy owls in captivity can live to 25 to even 30 years of age.[4][6][230] Typical lifespans probably reach around 10 years in the wild.[4][24] The longest known lifespan in the wild was one that initially banded (possibly in its first winter) in Massachusetts and recovered dead in Montana 23 years and 10-month later.[6] The annual survival rate for twelve females on Bylot Island was estimated at around 85–92.3%.[231] It is often reputed that snowy owls frequently died from starvation, with historical accounts frequently opined they "had to" leave their breeding grounds due to lemming "crashes" but would starve to the south.[66][92][122] However, it was proven fairly early on that snowy owls often do survive throughout the winter.[10] This is reinforced somewhat by small radio-tracking and banding studies of the northern Great Plains and the intermountain valleys of the northwestern United States.[122][232] More circumstance evidence shows a lack of starvation in the eastern part of North America as well.[233] There is evidence that some adults are known to return to the same wintering areas in ensuing years, areas which are far south of their breeding range.[234][235] At Logan Airport, most snowy owls that are seen appear to be in good condition.[6] Of 71 dead snowy owls found in winter in the northern Great Plains, 86% died from assorted traumas, including collisions with automobiles and other, usually manmade, objects as well as electrocutions and shootings. Only 14% of the 71 deaths were due to apparent starving. Data showed some owls appeared to incur injuries but healed and survived.[232] More evidence was found in wintering snowy owls in New York of healed fractures, though some may require surgery to recover.[236] 537 wintering birds in Saskatchewan were studied based on fat reserves, which were superior in females over males and adults over juveniles; while 31% of females lacked fat reserves, at least 45% of males found starving or in a state of infirmity were males and 63% turned into Wildlife rehabilitation centres were also males.[69] In British Columbia, of 177 snowy owl deaths, of owls to die, only a small percentage were due to natural causes, such as assumed starvation at 13% and 12% were "found dead".[180] 1 fledgling on Fetlar dead due to pneumonia and Staphylococcus while a second died from Aspergillosis.[157] Evidence shows that in Utqiaġvik during exceptionally prolonged rains (i.e. 2 to 3 days), nest-departed young in Utqiaġvik were vulnerable to starvation, leading to hypothermia and pneumonia.[6] Due to their natural history, the snowy owl may be effected more severely by blood parasitism than other raptors, due to lowered immunity.[237] Conversely, they appear to have lower levels of ectoparasites like chewing lice than in other large owls per large samples from Manitoba. The snowy owls averaged about 3.9 chewing lice per host against 7.5 for great grey owls and 10.5 for great horned owls.[238]</p>

    <p>This species presence and numbers is dependent on amount of food available. In "lemming years", snowy owls can appear to be quite abundant in habitat.[4] Numbers of snowy owls are difficult to estimate even within studies that take place over decades due to the nomadic nature of adults.[6] The population of Scandinavia has long been perceived as very small and ephemeral with Finland holding 0–100 pairs; Norway holding 1–20 pairs and Sweden holding 1–50 pairs.[6][239] A low breeding population within European Russia has been estimated to hold 1,300–4,500 pairs and Greenland to have 500–1,000 pairs.[240][241] Other than northern part of the American continent, a majority of the snowy owl's breeding range is in northern Russia, but overall estimates are not known.[6][242] An exact count of 4,871 individuals were seen on surveys between the Indigirka and Kolyma rivers.[3] The numbers estimated by Partners in Flight and other authors by the 2000s was that North America held about 72,500 snowy owls, about 30% of which were juveniles.[243][244] The Canadian population of snowy owls was estimated at 10,000–30,000 (in the 1990s) or even to 50,000–100,000 individuals, perhaps improbably.[245][246][247] Within Canada, the population on Banks Island was once claimed at up to 15,000–25,000 in productive years and in Queen Elizabeth Islands at about 932 individuals.[125][248] Alaska is the only state with breeding snowy owls but has probably quite a bit fewer breeding owls than does Canada.[249] Furthermore, the Partners in Flight and the IUCN estimated that the world population was roughly 200,000–290,000 individuals as recently as the 2000s.[250][251][252] However, in the 2010s, it has been discovered that all prior estimates were extremely excessive and that more precise numbers could be estimated with better surveying, phylogeographic data and more insights into the owl's free-wheeling wanderings.[2][6] It is now believed that there are only 14,000–28,000 mature breeding pairs of snowy owls in the world.[6][11] During lemming declines, the number of nesting females may drop down to as low as 1,700 worldwide, a dangerously low number, and the number of snowy owls worldwide is less than 10% of what it was once thought to be.[6][11][136] Due to the small and rapidly declining population, the snowy was uplisted in 2017 to being a vulnerable species by the IUCN.[2] A 52% decline has been inferred for the North American population since the 1960s with another even more drastic estimate placing the decline from 1970 to 2014 at 64%.[253] Trends are harder to delineate in Scandinavia but a similar downward trend is thought to be occurring.[6][239]</p>
